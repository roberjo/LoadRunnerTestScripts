## Overview
Welcome to the **LoadRunnerTestScripts** repository! This collection of scripts is designed to assist performance testers and engineers in automating load testing using **Micro Focus LoadRunner**. The scripts cover a variety of use cases, including web applications, APIs, and database performance testing.

## Features
- Pre-configured **VuGen** scripts for different protocols.
- Parameterization and correlation examples.
- Best practices for **LoadRunner** scripting.
- Sample test scenarios for various workloads.
- Reusable functions to enhance script modularity.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before using these scripts, ensure you have the following:
- **Micro Focus LoadRunner** installed (Community or Enterprise Edition)
- Basic knowledge of LoadRunner **VuGen**
- Access to the target application or API under test

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/roberjo/LoadRunnerTestScripts.git
   ```
2. Open **LoadRunner VuGen** and load the script you want to use.
3. Configure runtime settings as needed.
4. Execute the script to validate functionality.

## Repository Structure
